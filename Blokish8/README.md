#Blokish8

Open-source Android implementation of the popular board game Blokus. With very smooth Drag & Drop user interface.

Live on Google Play : http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.scoutant.blokish. More than 50.000 downloads.

Blokus is family game involving four players and a board with 20 x 20 squares. Like chess or checkers, it's a game for which at any time you can see your opponent's pieces.

Each player starts with 21 pieces : 1 monomino, 1 domono, 2 triominos, 5 tetraminos and 12 pentaminos. It may recall you the Tetris polyominos...

"For first round, I must place a piece so that it touches one of the corners of the board"

"Next, a piece must be placed so that it touches a corner of one of my own pieces.
It may touch several corners, but never any side/edge of my pieces!" Look at screenshots.

The game has a nice and natural User Interface : just Drag & Drop the piece with the finger. Rotate a piece likewise. And return a piece with a long press.

"If a cannot place any more piece I pass my turn."

The end of the game is reached when every player passes.
"My score is : addition of the squares of the pieces I placed".

Refer to 'Menu > Help' inside the app. With several screenshots.

You can safely quit at any time : your current game will be restored on next startup.

Last piece played is displayed both enlarged and with higher contrast. 

You play against the machine. You can configure the level of corresponding Artificial Intelligence : 4 levels. Refer to Menu > Preferences

You can disable AI for a human play only. Refer to Menu > Preferences.

The software has no unobtrusive banner advertising.
Once installed, you can play off-line.

The game is free. And even more : the code is open-source. 
You can access it at http://github.com/scoutant.
You can reuse and adapt it according to GPL v3 license.
